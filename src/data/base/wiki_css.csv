"About CSS","CSS, The Computer Science Society is a group of elected students that represent all undergraduate students enrolled in Computer Science at the University of Windsor. We aim to improve the university experience for all CS students by hosting outings, workshops, providing resources, and more! How do I get Involved? Everyone in the Computer Science Society is elected by you, the undergraduate students in CS. See the CSS Constitution which contains the titles and descriptions of all roles in CSS. Elections are now split up into two rounds. Nominations for the first round of positions which includes all head and executive positions takes place in February, and the second round for the rest of the positions takes place in March. If a student runs for a position in the first round and fails to get the votes, they may run for another position in the second round.
