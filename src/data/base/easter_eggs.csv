"March 19","On the fateful day of March 19, 2025 the CSS discord server received the news that Affan Shahid had won the CSS presidency, defeating Calder Johnson by 8 votes. This event came with a lot of Affan supporters raiding the server and doing some trolling that eventually got #general locked for 1 hour. Later a student started spelling out an offensive word and when confronted by a :snake: emoji, they started crashing out and got banned. The controversial upset echoes through history to this day and has forever altered the course of CSS for better or for worse..."
"History of the snake emoji","The full history of the snake emoji is a truly deep and dark tale. On December 30th, 2024 a member of the CSS discord server asked for resume tips but explicitly mention they did not want to send their resume to the public channel. On January 1st, 2025, when confronted about the strange choice by Tanzim Houssain, the member said 'I kept it out of here cus there are snakes like u lerching around'. Just like that Tanzim was labeled a snake and the member had unknowningly cemented themselves into the history of CSS. From that point on, the :snake: emoji was used in a joking manner by certain unemployed members with nothing better to do. All was going good until March 19th, 2025 when this same member started spelling out an offensive word and when confronted by a :snake: emoji from Aditya Patel, the member started crashing out, using slurs and eventually got banned. This fateful event brought this niche copypasta to a broader audience, and to this day the :snake: emoji meme is still massive!"
