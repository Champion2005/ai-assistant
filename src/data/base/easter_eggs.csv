"march-19","On March 19, 2025 the CSS discord server received the news that Affan Shahid had won the CSS presidency, beating Calder Johnson. This event came with a lot of Affan supporters raiding the server and did some trolling that eventually got #general locked for 1 hour. Later a student started spelling out an offensive word and when confronted by a :snake: emoji, they started crashing out and got banned. Finally, when asked if Affan supported LGBTQ+ rights, he responded with a response that is similar to the phrase ""All Lives Matter""."
