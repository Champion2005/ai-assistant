"becoming-a-ta part 1","What is a TA? A TA (Teaching Assistant) is a unionized student position where undergraduate students can work with instructors (often professors) to run University of Windsor courses. Instructors could ask for a TA's help in a variety of ways: Holding Office Hours Grade student assessments Proctor Exams Taking notes or answering questions during classes. A TA refers to an undergraduate student while GA (Graduate Assistant) refers to Graduate students. Why should you become a TA? Being a TA provides many benefits: Work experience with a subject of interest, Create connections with Professors and Instructors, Further your own learning on the subject, Paid Position, The Collective Agreement. As mentioned above, the position of a TA is paid. This rate of pay is determined in the CUPE 4580 Collective Agreement. This agreement is where you will find all detailed information about the position and its relationship with the University and the Union. To find the rate of pay in the Collective Agreement review Schedule 'A' in the current collective agreement 1. There you will find: TA I make $20.39/hour (As of 01/01/2021) TA II (Year 3 and Year 4 Students) make $21.99/hour (As of 01/01/2021) Be sure to read your rights in the Collective Agreement, it is filled with important information about the position. How to become a TA? To become a TA a student typically needs to have completed their first year of courses. The processes will usually begin a few months before the start of the next term. The processes starts with an email from the department explaining which courses will require TA positions and how many positions are available. This email will cover which courses will have positions available and basic information about the positions like: All courses and labs will be on campus (including some Distance Education courses that may require on campus office hours); All GA/TA employees must make themselves available, and must be available for all assigned duties, both on campus and online as required; Each GA position is expected to be for a total of 140 hours. A limited number of GA positions may be available for fewer hours The total number of hours of a TA appointment will depend on the number of applications received and is anticipated to be 75100 hours per position. Note that Teaching Assistants can be employed for no more than 100 TA hours per semester total Once confirming that you meet the basic requirements for eligibility: Successful completion of the course (80% minimum average) or demonstrated experience/knowledge in subject matter (which will be determined by interview), Must have a minimum cumulative average of 75%, Must have a minimum major average of 80%, Must have excellent communication skills, Brightspace/Teams experience, Must be familiar with Brightspace and MS Teams or be able to acquire knowledge through training. Remote internet access requirements: Must have access to a computer with a reliable internet connection with video and audio capabilities Or reviewing to see if you meet the preferred requirements:"
"becoming-a-ta part 2","Preferred qualifications will only be considered if there are 2 or more applicants who meet the required essential qualifications and who are relatively equal based on the criteria as per articles 12:03 or 12:04 of the CUPE 4580 collective agreement Preference for TA positions will be given to applicants registered in a Computer Science program Completion of CTL GA/TA Academy workshop (s) is an asset Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL) Brightspace Training completed You can begin the process by visiting the School of Computer Science Online GA/TA Application website. There are 5 pages to fill out, including your contact information, previous experiences, and top 10 courses ranked in order of your preferred placement. Once the form is submitted, if a successful candidate you will hear back from the University with an offer letter typically 14 weeks before classes begin. One important thing to note is the University has the right to change your position if needed. This means if you are offered to TA for one course and sign the contract, they could simply send you an email saying you have been reassigned to another course instead. To accept a TA position there are a few steps involved: 1. Reply to the email offer with a message accepting the offer E.g. 'I accept this offer and confirm that I will be available to report for inperson duties in F/W/S term 20XX.' 2. Confirm you are enrolled in at least one course 3. Digitally sign the contract 4. Complete the HR hiring package This will include signing multiple forms for the University's records like an offer letter, duties check list, Ontario Taxes form, Canadian Taxes form (TD1), and possibly more. Some forms will ask for an employee number, if this is your first time working for the University leave this blank and they will provide you with one on a later date. If you have an employee number but do not remember it, look at your employee profile on the University of Windsor Employee Site 5. Ping a Mod in the CSS Discord to give you the TA Role This role will help students recognize you as a TA, giving you another space to help students It could also assist you as a way to contact other TAs in case you have a further question about the process, or responsibilities involved. Once you submit all of your paper work you must wait for confirmation from HR before beginning any work as a TA. You can communicate and meet with the instructor, however not begin any work until this confirmation is received. TA Resources Once accepting a TA position there are workshops that are offered by the University that you can take to help you during your term. Some training courses are required, others optional. Most are one time only, meaning the next time you are a TA, you will not be required to do them again. You can also log into your University of Windsor Employee Site(https://myuwinfo.uwindsor.ca/default) to see you payment information, completed trainings, T4, and other information. Citations 1.

"contributing","We're so thrilled that you want to help out with the UWindsor Computer Science Student Wiki Project! This article will contain everything you need to know to start updating existing articles, writing your own articles, and using GitHub to get your code merged into the main codebase. Setting up Your Local Environment Prerequisites You'll need to install some prerequisite software before contributing to the wiki (git, nodejs, yarn). Full instructions can be found on the wiki's README. Running the Development Server Once you've installed all the prerequisites, you're ready to run the wiki locally Simply run `yarn start` in your terminal, and the wiki should automatically open up from the address http://localhost:3000/wiki/. You can now edit the content of any article and see it automatically change in the browser. Updating Existing Articles The simplest way to contribute is to add to or update an existing article. To do this, simply find the relevant `.md` file for the corresponding article you'd like to update, and edit the contents. That's it! After you edit the content you should be able to see it change in the browser. If the article you're updating contains a 'Last Updated' date at the start of it, make sure to update it with the current date Make sure to also follow the style guide and article requirements when updating an article. Creating New Articles Creating new articles is a bit more complex than updating existing ones, but if you follow the pattern of other articles, you'll catch on quickly. The first thing you need to consider is where your article should be located on the wiki, and where it should be located in the actual code. Luckily, the layout of files and folders in the wiki codebase usually follows the layout of the site itself. So, if you wanted to create a new `guide` article, you'd create a new `.md` file under `resources/guides`. When opening up any of the existing markdown files, you'll probably notice that each one starts off with a section of Markdown with a bunch of information. Including this top section before beginning your article is vital if you want it to show up on the wiki. Each field is fairly self explanatory, but here's a quick rundown anyways: id: This is a descriptive string that uniquely identifies your article. It's useful for sidebars. title: The title of your article, this is automatically rendered as an `h1` at the beginning of your article. sidebarlabel: Self explanatory, shows up on the sidebar to link to your article. slug: This refers to what is appended to the url when going to your article. Slugs are expected to adhere to a format featuring all lowercase letters and hyphens between words. For example, if you're creating a guide about 'Topic A', you might make the slug `/guides/topica`. File names should follow the same naming scheme. Once you have this section completed, you now need to edit the relevant `XXXX.sidebars.js` file to create a link for it in the sidebar of whatever section you're writing the article for. For example, if you're creating a new guide you would update `resourcessidebars.js`. Look for items near where you'd like to place your article. Here, you can see that to add a new guide, you'll need to add an item here. If your article has an id of 'someID', you'll add the following:js 'guides/someID', If, say, you wanted to add an article about CSS, you'll notice the sidebars file is a bit different."
"first-year-guide","id: firstyearguide title: First Year Guide sidebarlabel: First Year Guide slug: /guides/firstyear last updated on 2024/09/15 This guide is intended to help incoming first year students prepare for a computer science degree at the University of Windsor. It addresses some general information about being a student at the University of Windsor and provides resources specifically to help students succeed in computer science courses. Getting Started at the University of Windsor UWin Accounts Every student must have a UWin Account in order to access the university's online services. Instructions to set up your UWin account will be sent to your personal email after you've been accepted into a program at the university. You will be assigned a UWin ID and will create a password during this process; these will be used as your login information. Your UWindsor email will be yourUWinI@uwindsor.ca. Online Services Some of the online services you can access using your UWin Account include: UWinsite Student For browsing and enrolling in classes, viewing tuition and fees, accessing acedamic information, applying for scholarships, and more. See the UWinsite Guide for more details and help. Brightspace The university's Learning Management System (LMS). It is used to view course material, submit coursework, review grades, and more. Microsoft Office 365 All University of Windsor students have access to a full suite of Microsoft Office 365 tools and software, including Outlook for email services and OneDrive for 1 TB of free cloud storage. A Microsoft Account is automatically created using your UWindsor Email and UWin Account Password. See this FAQ for more details. Enrolling in Courses Which Courses to Take important These wiki resources are maintained by student contributors. Always verify important academic information with a primary university resource or an academic advisor. There are several computer science programs offered by the University of Windsor, each with their own course requirements which can be found in the undergraduate calendar. If you follow the recommended course sequence, many programs will share the same courses for the first term. They are COMP1000, COMP1400, MATH1250 (or MATH1260), MATH1720 (or MATH1760), and an elective. See the Courses section for a userfriendly table of course requirements by program. How to Enroll Incoming first year students typically have the earliest appointment time and may enroll in courses before all other students. Your appointment time can be found on UWinsite under My Academics > Enrollment Deadlines. It is recommended to enroll as early as possible, as courses have a limited capacity and desireable timeslots fill up quickly. See the UWinsite Guide for more details on how to enroll in classes. Recommended Software for Computer Science For a detailed guide on the recommended software for computer science students, see Recommended Software."
"recommended-software part 1","As a computer science student, you will learn to program in a variety of programming languages, starting with the C Programming Language in COMP1400. Installing and familiarizing yourself with the necessary software on your personal computer before the first day of classes will save you time and stress, especially if you are new to programming. All of the following software can be downloaded for free. Code Editor: Visual Studio Code Description A code editor helps a programmer write code (like Microsoft Word but for programming). Code can be written in any text editor, but a good code editor will provide features like syntax highlighting, basic error checking, and autocompletion for several programming languages. Note that a code editor is not an IDE (integrated development environment). For example, Visual Studio is an IDE while Visual Studio Code is a code editor and a seperate piece of software. An IDE will typically provide builtin tools to run, debug, and examine your code for a specific language, while a code editor will not (or will require you to install additional tools to do so)."
"recommended-software part 2","Visual Studio Code (VS Code or VSC) is recommended in this guide. It provides builtin support for several programming languages, including C, and hundreds more are supported through downloadable extensions. It is recommended over an IDE for two reasons: (1) its portability to other programming languages and (2) it forces students to learn how to transform code into an executable program using the command line. Installing Windows, Mac, and Linux downloads are available on the official website. Instructions for each operating system can be found with a quick web search if needed. Resources First Year Bootcamp Setting up VSCode Workshop: a workshop hosted by CSS to get VS Code up and running on Windows. Note that this workshop also provides a way to install a C compiler using MinGW, which is an alternative way to the one recommended in this guide, using WSL. MinGW is not needed for VS Code itself, and can be skipped in favour of WSL (see the next section). Windows Subsystem for Linux (Windows Only) Description Linux is the preferred operating system for many programmers. It is also the operating system found on the School of Computer Science's servers and computers, which you will need to use for class work and verifying code compatibility (code written on one system may behave differently on another system). For these reasons, it is recommended that students familiarize themselves with the Linux environment. Recent versions of Windows have made it easy to work in a Linux environment within Windows, rather than having to run it in a virtual machine or as a secondary operating system. This is done using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Installing The official WSL guide provides more details about WSL, its features, and how to install it. However, enabling and installing WSL on the most recent versions of Windows (Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, or Windows 11) is now as easy as typing the following command in an administrator command prompt or Windows PowerShell window, which can be found be searching in the start menu for either and right clicking the icon to select Run as administrator. wsl install note By default, this command installs Ubuntu as the Linux distribution, which is popular among those new to Linux. If you are interested in other distributions, see the guide. On older version of Windows 10, you can install WSL manually. Once WSL is installed, you can start it in a command prompt or PowerShell window by entering `wsl`. Getting Started The first thing to do on a fresh install is to update any out of date software. A Package Manager makes this easy on Linux: it's like the app store on your phone, but for all of the software on your computer. On Ubuntu, the default package manager is apt. You can update everything at once using the following commands. sudo aptget update && sudo aptget upgrade Shell: Bash, Zsh, or many others Description A shell is used to interact with your system and run programs using text commands. It is often favoured over or used alongside a graphical user interface (GUI) environment by programmers. Windows running WSL, Mac, and Linux each can use a different default shell, but all Unix shells will share the same basic commands. Installing On Windows, see the WSL section. A shell will be installed with your distribution of Linux. On Mac, use the 'Terminal' app. Getting Started Typically, a shell will display some information before your cursor, though the format can differ. In this example, everything up to and including the dollar sign is information provided to you by the shell about you and your system.sh username@computername foldername/or/path$ echo 'Chip says hello'"
"recommended-software part 3","The following are some basic commands: `ls` will list the contents of the current folder. `cd folderName` will move you to the folder named 'folderName'. `cd ~` will take you to your Home folder. `cd ..` will take you back out of the folder you are currently in. `echo 'Chip the Cool Cat'` will display 'Chip the Cool Cat' in your terminal. `cat fileName` will display the contents of a the file named 'fileName'. Some tips: You can scroll through your command history using the up and down arrows. ctrl+c can be used to kill a process that is running in your shell. C Compiler: GCC Description When you write C code, you need a way to make it executable on your system. This is where a compiler comes in: it reads in the more humanfriendly C code and outputs a program that your computer can read and run. GCC is the compiler you should use when developing C code for your classes, unless your professor specifies otherwise. When you compile code using a different compiler, or on a different system, your program may behave differently than it will on the school's system using GCC. For this reason, it is also sometimes recommended that you double check your programs on the School of Computer Science's systems before submitting more complicated assignments. Installing On Windows running WSL with Ubuntu , enter the following into your shell: sudo aptget install gcc On Mac, this video provides one way of installing GCC, as well as the Homebrew package manager. Getting Started This section will help you create a sample C program, compile it, and run it. Copy and paste the following code into a new file on your system. Call it 'hello.c' and remember where you save it.c include <stdio.h> int main(void) { printf('Chip says hello'); } Find the file in your shell. For example, if you put the file on your Desktop, use the following command to go to there.sh cd ~/Desktop Compile the program into a binary (runnable file, executable, etc.). `Wall` tells the compiler to output all warnings. `o hello.out` tells the compiler to save the created binary with the name 'hello.out'.sh gcc Wall hello.c o hello.out Run the binary you just created.sh ./hello.out The output should be Chip says hello Remote Connection: SSH and NoMachine Description As a computer science student, you have access to the School of Computer Science's servers, which provide software in a Linux environment that you are free to use. On campus, they can be accessed using School of Computer Science computer labs. Remotely, they can be accessed in several ways. SSH (recommended): Remotely use a shell on the server. NoMachine: Remote desktop environment. important You must authenticate your UWin account with the School of Computer Science before you can log in remotely. To log in remotely from offcampus, you must be on the VPN first. Please refer to our guide on how to set up the VPN here. SSH In a shell, use the following to connect to the school's servers. Replace 'UWinID' with your UWinID. ssh UWinID@cs.uwindsor.ca For example, if chipcoolcat@uwindsor.ca wanted to connect, they would use the following command. ssh chipcoolcat@cs.uwindsor.ca"
"laptop-guide part 1","Here are a few things to keep in mind when purchasing/configuring your laptop: Hardware Although the following specifications are not strictly required, having these minimum specifications will make your computer less frustrating to use: 8 GB of RAM for gaming/futureproof purposes, 12 or 16 GB is more preferable 256 GB of SSD storage. UWindsor provides 5GB OneDrive cloud storage. However, it is strongly recommended that you upgrade to at least 512 GB. This will allow you to have space for a lot of games and software, and the extra local storage is good if you don't want the hassle of constantly uploading and downloading files from the cloud. Operating System You aren't required to have certain OS since the School of Computer Science has remote Linux server that you can connect to, but here are a few pros and cons to help you decide which OS to use: Windows Windows is one of the most popular OS among students, particularly because it comes with most preassembled laptops. The user interface should be fairly intuitive even when you are new to using laptops, and it is one of the most supported OS for app availability or IT support. Additionally, it is much easier to game on Windows. Many Computer Science classes (COMP1400 and COMP1410, for example) will require programming environments that are harder to set up in Windows than in other UNIX/Linuxbased OS. Although substitutes like WSL can help, you might run into compatibility issues when working with sockets and pipes in classes like COMP2560. Virtual machines shouldn't have compatibility issues, but they can require a lot of computing power, especially when GUI is involved. Should you choose Windows as your primary OS, you should consider setting up an SSH connection to the UWindsor's remote server on editors like Visual Studio Code or via other means. In addition, when you are working with other developers on a project, you may also have to pay attention to your line breaks (CRLF vs. LF). If you are taking classes offered by other faculties or departments (e.g. Engineering), you may have to install software that are only available on Windows. However, this usually is not a concern since such instances are quite rare, and the University of Windsor has many other computer resources to help you out if something like this happens. Linux Linux/UNIX is very good for programming/developing because of how easy it is to set up the necessary environment. Much like MacOS, it can be difficult to game on. Depending on how important gaming is to you, you may need to use Wine, set up a virtual machine, or dualboot with Windows. Additionally, since many of the University's software (Office 365, OneDrive, Teams, etc.) are on the Microsoft platform, there may be some compatibility issues. Popular Linux distros include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Pop_OS, Linux Mint, and Arch Linux. If you are very new to Linux, then Ubuntu and Debian may be a good starting point for you simply because there is a large community using them and most likely have answers for any problem you encounter. The University, for example, uses Debian on its remote servers. If you have time and are willing to experiment, you should test out the different Linux OS since the desktop environment on Ubuntu and Debian (GNOME) can be slightly laggy on laptops without high specifications. If you are coming from Windows, Linux Mint's Cinnamon desktop environment will help you adjust to Linux as it has a look and feel comparable to that of Windows."
"laptop-guide part 2","Although Linux OS may be confusing for new users, becoming comfortable with a UNIX/Linux environment is very beneficial for you. The University generally expects you to produce code/projects that will work on its Linux server. As well, Linux forces you to interact with the command line more, which is great if you want to learn more about how your computer works underneath. Almost all Linux distros are free, especially the popular ones. In general, Linux distros require less disk space and perform better on lowend devices, compared to Windows. Thus, the right Linux distro will significantly optimize your laptop, especially if you are on a budget. However, Linux is also generally worse for battery life compared to other OS. MacOS Since the MacOS is a UNIX operating system, it is usually easier to set up local programming environment than Windows. As well, it is also among the most supported OS in terms of IT support and app availability. However, MacOS is generally not compatible with nonApple products. This means that you would need to purchase a MacBook to use MacOS, which may be expensive/less costeffective depending on your budget and what specifications you're looking for. Much like Linux OS, it can be difficult to game on. Depending on how important gaming is to you, you may need to use Wine, set up a virtual machine, or dualboot with Windows. ChromeOS (Chromebook) The ChromeOS is a Linuxbased operating system derived from the Chromium OS. However, ChromeOS is generally not compatible with nonChromebook products. Although Chromebooks are typically lightweight, portable and have good battery life, you usually cannot install much on them since they generally have low specifications. Although you can set up programming environments on them using a Linux container, having a low hardware specifications may decrease the performance. As such, Chromebooks (or other laptops like Surface Pro) are best used for doing quick works on the campus while having a more powerful desktop/laptop at home. Battery Life and Portability Battery life and portability are probably the most important factors that you should think about when purchasing a laptop. You should purchase a laptop that has decent battery life and is reasonably light. Alternatively, you can look for ergonomicallyengineered laptop bags that can store your chargers so that you won't get hurt as you exercise around the campus. Some factors, like a laptop's hardware, may affect its weight and battery life. Powerful CPUs, for example, often drains battery quicker. Extremely small and lightweight laptops often have smaller fans and vents and thus heat up easily, which can also reduce battery life. It is therefore important to research about your laptop choices and test them in person before making a purchase. Screen Size Common screen size range from 13' to 17', but it is recommended to keep your selection between 13'' to 15'' for portability. If you are looking for a more portable laptop, then 13'' will be a better choice. However, this also means that you will see less content on the screen at a time, especially when you make the fonts bigger for ergonomic purposes. On the other hand, a 15'' laptop can display more content but are also heavier and thus less portable. Other Features Although features like 2in1 and touchscreen are very useful for purposes like digital art, they may not be very useful on the campus other than taking digital notes. If you are purchasing a laptop that is going to mostly be used on campus, then you can subsitute with a drawing tablet to save money."
"parking-guide","This is a guide to the parking spaces around the campus. See this map if you would like to see the different UWindsor buildings beforehand. Official UWindsor Parking Spaces There are 17 official parking lots within the UWindsor campus. This includes visitor parking, staff parking, and student parking. You can locate these parking lots in this campus map. a map outlining official uwindsor parking spaces for students, staff, and visitors Student Designated Parking Student parkings in UWindsor are either payanddisplay, permitonly, or both. Most student parkings are located around Alumni Hall, with a few more parking locations in Leddy, Cartier Hall, Assumption Hall, and the downtown campus. To obtain a student permit, visit the UWindsor Parking Online Services. Permits are either 8 months or 12 months (for Fall & Winter), or 2 months or 4 months (for Intersession & Summer). Note: While some of these locations (such as the Parking Garage) do not accept cash, some other parking locations (like Leddy special night parking) are coin entry only. For places where student permits and payanddisplay options are both allowed, you do not need to pay if you already have a student permit, but you must display your permit on your vehicle when parking. The hourly rate for parking is $2.00/hr, up to $10.00 maximum per day. As well, even if you have a student permit (or parking pay stub), you must follow the University's parking regulations. The University will fine or, whenever necessary, tow your vehicle if they discover that you have violated the regulations. Visitor Parking Space Visitors are able to use the Parking Garage and the designated visitor parkings around the area. Unlike students and staff, visitors cannot buy semester/year parking passes. Instead, visitors must pay a parking rate by the hour, by the day, by the week, or by the month. However, the University also provides vendor permits in the student parking lots. Accessible Parking The University of Windsor will provide accessible parking to people who requests parking spaces. If you require accessible parking or any other accommodations, make sure to contact the Campus Parking Services and the Office of Human Rights, Equity and Accessibility. They will work with you to make sure that your requests will be fulfilled to the best of their abilities.

"student-exchange-guide part 1","Jose thinks exchanges are fun and 100% worth it. The Exchange Coordinator, Michelle, is a fantastic and knowledgable person and can help you with any concerns/questions. You can hear about Jose's experience at Jose's University of Essex Experience. In addition, there is a series of UWindsor video you can watch clarifying some information about Student Exchange, or you can contact Michelle Bondy. Open Office Hours with Michelle. Eligibility Requirement When you apply to go on a student exchange, the following requirements are considered. These requirements aren't set in stone, however, and you may still be considered during special circumstances or if you can satisfy the requirements in some other way: Be enrolled in a UWindsor degree program during the exchange, Have a cumulative average of 72%+ at the time of application, Be in good academic standing, Have completed two years (~20 courses) worth of University-level education before exchange, Proficiency in second language (when the host institution does not teach in English). In addition, you must follow these exchange policies as CS students: You can only exchange for up to one academic year per degree program, You must have a full course load (as defined by the host institution) during the exchange, You will not normally be eligible for refund of tuition if you withdraw from exchange before completing the current semester. If you took classes recognized for credit by the host institution for their students, then these classes will be recognized for credit by UWindsor. The opposite also applies. Your grades in these courses will be transformed into UWindsor grades. Exchange Destinations Students in Computer Science programs can go to different destinations of exchange depending on the program/host institution applied for. Usually, each program/host institution has only 14 spots for exchange. This number of spaces, however, can change depending on the agreements made between the University of Windsor and the host institution. Since not all spaces are available every year or every semester, it is strongly recommended that you check the Destination by Major and Current Available Destinations before you apply for your destination of choice. Depending on the host institution, you may be required to prove proficiency in the language that the institution teaches in. As for now, the following destinations available to CS students teach in a language other than English: France, Germany, Italy, Mexico. In such scenario, you may need to take a language assessment with the Languages department as arranged by the Exchange Office. Exchange Expenses Here are some expenses that you should consider before going on an exchange: Tuition and ancillary fees UWindsor students will continue to pay their normal UWindsor tuition and ancillary fees, and no tuition/application fees are charged by the host institution. Student association fees, however, are waived. UWSA supplementary health insurance are charged, but students can still optout. Travel and accommodation/living costs These costs will also include costs for visa, passport and other travel documents. The host institution can help students find accommodations, generally in the forms of student residence and meal plans. Insurance Students must purchase health insurance, in addition to OHIP, appropriate for the country of destination. The host institution may provide this insurance for students to purchase. The University of Windsor has a page detailing some of the financial assistance you can receive for exchange. Students can also apply to the University of Windsor International Mobility Award. In addition, the Government of Canada and Ontario has programs to provide financial aid for students studying abroad."
"student-exchange-guide part 2","Sometimes, your country of destination may also provide financial aid programs for students studying in their country. If your country of destination allows international students to do parttime work, you may also work during exchange to cover a part of your expenses. Application Process Students interested in applying must have these components in their application: Exchange Online Application, Three Reference Letters/Forms, The form must be completed and returned by the references, not the student. One of the three references must be a UWindsor faculty member who has taught the student in a class. Language Assessment (if applicable) After applying, you may be interviewed by the Exchange Office to determine your interest in the exchange program. The Exchange Office has a selection committee who will review the applications, interview the applicants, and rank candidates based on the following criteria: Seriousness of interest This can be demonstrated in the depth of research you showcase about the school(s) you applied for. Suitability of the host institution’s program for degree requirements Ability to be a good ambassador and representative of the University and the city while away Interesting classes you noted when making your application for exchange. You are not expected to make a class schedule when applying for exchange, but this is a nice bonus point. Personal adaptability Participation in university and community life Academic ability The interview may be conducted in a second language if the school(s) you applied for does not teach in English. In addition, the interview is a great opportunity for you to ask some questions you have about the exchange. Important Deadline important You should send in your complete application (including the language assessment and reference forms to be sent by the references) before the specified deadline to get priority when considered for exchange placements. Although late applications are still accepted, late applicants are only considered when there is remaining space and time. January 15th (before 3 pm) application deadline for students beginning exchange in September (1 or 2 semesters) Applications are usually available around midOctober. September 15th (before 3 pm) application deadline for students beginning exchange in January (1 semester) Applications are usually available around late June. Generally, students are recommended to apply during their second year and begin exchange during their third year to allow for flexibility in course selection when studying abroad. To ensure that your graduation is not delayed, you should consult with your academic department/advisor about the interest you have for the exchange program. Note: Students going on exchange in their final semester may have their convocation delayed due to the time needed to process transfer credits."

"uwsa-club","Why You Should Become a UWSA Ratified Club There are many reasons why you should consider becoming a UWSA ratified club. Whether you're starting a new club or thinking of taking your existing club to the next level, becoming UWSA ratified may be incredibly useful Legitimacy Being a UWSA club means your group is officially recognized, and as such, your club gains legitimacy. Knowing that your club has as organization behind it helps move things forward with administration and helps to show your members that your club is 'real'. Support Managing a club is hard, but managing a club without someone to go to is even harder. One of the great things about being a part of UWSA is the advice and support they can provide. Whenever you aren't sure about something or need administrative advice on how to run your club, UWSA is able to provide support. Financials A common problem with clubs is finding a safe and reliable place to store club funds. UWSA allows all student groups to store their funds in the UWSA account, which eliminates this problem. You can deposit cash and cheques with UWSA to store the funds safely, and ensure they carry over year after year. There are two main ways to use the funds in your UWSA account: reimbursement and purchase orders. Reimbursement The main way you'll be able to make use of your club funds is via reimbursement. This means you pay for something out of your own money, send a cheque request, and UWSA will send you the money. Cheque requests need to be approved by at least two of the three executives (President, Vice President, Treasurer). Purchase Orders Sometimes, UWSA can make purchases on your behalf to avoid club members needing to pay out of pocket. This typically only happens for larger purchases. For example, if your group wants to spend $500 to get tshirts for group members, UWSA can purchase the shirts on your group's behalf (so long as your group has sufficient funds). If you ever have any questions about UWSA group financials, send an email to vpfuwsa@uwindsor.ca Ratification Instructions 1. Have three people to serve as the President, Vice President, and Treasurer of the group. 2. Have these three executives sign the UWSA signature form. 3. Collect the contact information of at least 10 additional members to be part of the club. This means at least 13 members total, 3 executives and 10 general members. You may want to use something like Microsoft Forms or Google Forms to collect this info. You should collect their name and UWindsor email. 4. Send an email to studentgroups@uwindsor.ca and uwsa@uwindsor.ca with the member contact information list, the signature form, and a short description of your club. 5. Allow up to a week to hear a response, if you don't hear anything then send a follow up email.

"wifi-guide","This is a guide to connecting to WiFi on campus. WiFi Networks available When you connect your wireless WiFi device (phone/PC/Mac) to the network, you will see the available wireless networks listed which you can try to connect to. eduroam, uwinsecure, uwindsor, Which should you use? The short answer is ``Connect to eduroam``. The eduroam wireless network is available to all wireless users (Students/Faculty/Staff/guests). Plus it has the additional benefit that users from other eduroam institutions (many universities, for example) can also connect to the University of Windsor’s wireless network using their home institution’s crededentials. Eduroam The Preferred Wireless Network alt text Eduroam is a network used by many universities, and your UWindsor sign in will work at any campus that uses eduroam. 1. Open WiFi settings on your device and select the “eduroam” network 2. Depending on your device you will be prompted for different settings. Here is the list of all possibilities. Fill in any you see. (Most computers will only ask for Username and Password) For Windows and iPhone < EAP method: PEAP Phase 2 authentication: MSCHAPV2 CA certificate: Use System Certificates (or leave blank if this is not an option) > Identity (username): Your full UWindsor email (example@uwindsor.ca) < Anonymous identity: Your full UWindsor email (example@uwindsor.ca) > Password: Your UWinID password If prompted to trust a certificate after signing in (mainly iPhone) click trust. For Linux and Android WiFi Secuirty: WPA & WPA2 Enterprise Authentication: Protected EAP (PEAP) Anonymous Identity (username): Your full UWindsor email (example@uwindsor.ca) Domain: uwindsor.ca CA certificate: None PEAP Version: Automatic Inner Authentication: MSCHAPv2 Identity (username): Your full UWindsor email (example@uwindsor.ca) Password: Your UWinID password The uwindsor wireless network is available for use but should only be used as a last resort. Unlike eduroam and uwinsecure, the uwindsor network does not encrypt the network traffic. So, for example, if you are accessing network applications using a protocol which is insecure, (eg. http instead of https), then everyone else using the uwindsor network in the vicinity could view your network activity. The wireless network called uwindsor is not secure. For Residence Students While Eduroam is the primary campuswide WiFi network, you may want to use UWinResLife in your hall for heavier use (i.e. streaming or downloading). Sign in using your UWindsor ID (just the first part not @uwindsor.ca), and your UWinID password. Activating Your UWindsor Account You use your UWindsor ID to sign into your UWinsite Student, Brightspace, MySuccess, etc. Your UWindsor email address is your ID @uwindsor.ca and signin is via Gmail. To activate your ID, you will require your 9digit Student Number and 4digit Personal Access Code (PAC). Find these by searching your inbox, or on your acceptance letter.
